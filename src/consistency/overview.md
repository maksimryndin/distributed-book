Martin Kleppman Critique CAP

latency-sensitivity framework

availability as a metric

operational and network latency

algorithm sensitivity to latency

Network partitions *can be modelled as large packet delays (up to the duration of the partition), provided that the duration of the partition is finite and lost packets are retransmitted an unbounded number of times*[^kleppmann].
